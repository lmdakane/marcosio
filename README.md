# MARINE AND COASTAL OPERATIONS SOUTHERN AFRICA (MarCOSIO) PROJECT

The Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and Africa Marine and Coastal Operations for Southern Africa (MarCOSIO) project, aims to maintain, further develop and provide a sustainable platform for local, institutional, human and technical capabilities across Southern African countries.

This will be achieved through the development of regionally-optimised satellite observations and model-based forecast services focused on sustainable socio-economic development for the South and East African marine and coastal domains.

MarCOSIO is funded through the GMES and Africa programme and forms part of its Marine and Coastal Operations thematic area.
